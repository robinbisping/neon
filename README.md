# Node example API

An example project that shows how one could structure an API with JWT authentication in node. It uses the following dependencies:

- [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expressjs)
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- [Jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
- And a few others. Check `package.json` for further details.

_Work in progress._
